      "question": "Why does aniline not undergo Friedel-Crafts reaction?",
      "answer": "Aniline does not undergo Friedel-Crafts reaction because the nitrogen atom of the -NH₂ group forms a complex with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), making the catalyst unavailable and the aromatic ring less reactive towards electrophilic substitution.",
      "category": "Amines",
      "detailedExplanation": "In Friedel-Crafts reactions, a Lewis acid catalyst like AlCl₃ is required to generate electrophiles. However, the lone pair on nitrogen in aniline coordinates strongly with AlCl₃, forming a complex: C₆H₅NH₂·AlCl₃. This deactivates both the catalyst and the aromatic ring since the nitrogen becomes positively charged, making the ring less electron-rich and thus less reactive towards electrophilic substitution.",

      "question": "Why is (CH₃)₂NH more basic than (CH₃)₃N in aqueous solution?",
      "answer": "In aqueous solution, (CH₃)₂NH is more basic than (CH₃)₃N due to a combination of inductive effect and solvation effect. While trimethylamine has more +I effect, dimethylamine experiences better solvation of its conjugate acid.",
      "category": "Amines",
      "detailedExplanation": "The basicity trend in aqueous solution for methylamines is: (CH₃)₂NH > CH₃NH₂ > (CH₃)₃N > NH₃. Although (CH₃)₃N has more electron-donating methyl groups, its conjugate acid [(CH₃)₃NH]⁺ has only one N-H bond for hydrogen bonding with water, resulting in poorer solvation. In contrast, [(CH₃)₂NH₂]⁺ has two N-H bonds, allowing better solvation and stabilization in aqueous medium, making dimethylamine more basic.",

      "question": "Why do primary amines have higher boiling points than tertiary amines?",
      "answer": "Primary amines have higher boiling points than tertiary amines because primary amines can form intermolecular hydrogen bonds due to the presence of N-H bonds, while tertiary amines cannot form such bonds as they lack N-H bonds.",
      "category": "Amines",
      "detailedExplanation": "Primary amines (R-NH₂) contain two N-H bonds that allow extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonding between molecules. This requires more energy to break during boiling. Tertiary amines (R₃N) have no N-H bonds and can only form weaker dipole-dipole interactions and van der Waals forces, resulting in lower boiling points despite similar molecular weights.",
      "keyPoints": [
        "Primary amines form intermolecular H-bonds via N-H bonds",
        "Tertiary amines lack N-H bonds, so no intermolecular H-bonding",

      "question": "What is the Hofmann bromamide degradation reaction?",
      "answer": "Hofmann bromamide degradation is a reaction where primary amides are converted to primary amines with one less carbon atom using bromine and sodium hydroxide.",
      "category": "Amines",
      "detailedExplanation": "The reaction involves treatment of a primary amide (RCONH₂) with bromine (Br₂) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH), resulting in the formation of a primary amine (RNH₂) with one carbon less than the original amide. The mechanism involves formation of an isocyanate intermediate which rearranges to give the amine. The reaction follows: RCONH₂ + Br₂ + 4NaOH → RNH₂ + Na₂CO₃ + 2NaBr + 2H₂O",

      "category": "Amines",
      "detailedExplanation": "Diazotisation involves the reaction of primary aromatic amines with nitrous acid (generated in situ from NaNO₂ and HCl) at 0-5°C to form diazonium salts. The general reaction is: Ar-NH₂ + NaNO₂ + 2HCl → Ar-N₂⁺Cl⁻ + NaCl + 2H₂O.

      "question": "Why are aromatic diazonium salts more stable than aliphatic diazonium salts?",
      "answer": "Aromatic diazonium salts are more stable than aliphatic diazonium salts due to resonance stabilization of the diazonium group with the aromatic ring.",
      "category": "Amines",
      "detailedExplanation": "In aromatic diazonium salts (Ar-N₂⁺), the positive charge on the terminal nitrogen is delocalized into the aromatic ring through resonance. This resonance stabilization makes aromatic diazonium salts relatively stable, especially at low temperatures (0-5°C). In contrast, aliphatic diazonium salts (R-N₂⁺) lack this resonance stabilization and are highly unstable, decomposing immediately to give carbocations and nitrogen gas.",

      "category": "Amines",
      "detailedExplanation": "Primary amines (like aniline) undergo carbylamine reaction with chloroform and alcoholic potassium hydroxide to form foul-smelling isocyanides. Secondary and tertiary amines (like N,N-dimethylaniline) do not give this reaction. Reaction: C₆H₅NH₂ + CHCl₃ + 3KOH → C₆H₅NC + 3KCl + 3H₂O.

      "question": "Why is Gabriel phthalimide synthesis not preferred for preparing aromatic primary amines?",
      "answer": "Gabriel phthalimide synthesis is not preferred for aromatic primary amines because aryl halides do not undergo nucleophilic substitution easily with phthalimide ion due to resonance stabilization and partial double bond character of C-X bond.",
      "category": "Amines",
      "detailedExplanation": "In Gabriel synthesis, phthalimide anion acts as a nucleophile. Aryl halides are unreactive towards nucleophilic substitution under normal conditions because: (1) The C-X bond has partial double bond character due to resonance, (2) The ring carbon is sp² hybridized, making it less susceptible to nucleophilic attack, (3) The leaving group (X⁻) is a poor leaving group in aromatic systems. Aliphatic halides work well as they undergo SN2 reactions easily.",

      "category": "Amines",
      "detailedExplanation": "In Hinsberg test, primary amines react with benzenesulphonyl chloride to form N-alkylbenzenesulphonamides. These contain an acidic hydrogen attached to nitrogen that can be removed by NaOH, forming a water-soluble sodium salt: R-NH₂ + C₆H₅SO₂Cl → C₆H₅SO₂NHR → C₆H₅SO₂NR⁻Na⁺ (soluble in alkali).

      "question": "Why are aliphatic amines stronger bases than ammonia?",
      "answer": "Aliphatic amines are stronger bases than ammonia due to the +I (electron-donating) effect of alkyl groups which increases electron density on nitrogen, making it better proton acceptor.",
      "category": "Amines",
      "detailedExplanation": "Alkyl groups in aliphatic amines are electron-donating through +I effect and hyperconjugation. This increases the electron density on the nitrogen atom, making the lone pair more available for protonation. The stability of the conjugate acid (alkylammonium ion) is also enhanced through dispersal of positive charge and solvation effects. This makes aliphatic amines stronger bases than ammonia.",
