      "question": "Why does carboxylic acid not give reactions of carbonyl group?",
      "answer": "Carboxylic acids do not give typical carbonyl reactions because the carbonyl carbon is less electrophilic due to resonance with the adjacent hydroxyl group, making it less reactive towards nucleophilic addition.",
      "category": "Carboxylic Acids",
      "detailedExplanation": "In carboxylic acids (-COOH), the carbonyl group participates in resonance with the -OH group. The lone pair on oxygen delocalizes into the carbonyl π* orbital, creating a partial double bond character between carbon and oxygen. This resonance (C=O ↔ C-O⁻ with O⁺-H) makes the carbonyl carbon less electrophilic and less susceptible to nucleophilic attack compared to aldehydes and ketones.",

      "question": "Why is benzoic acid a stronger acid than acetic acid?",
      "answer": "Benzoic acid is stronger than acetic acid because the phenyl group stabilizes the conjugate base through resonance, while the methyl group in acetic acid has an electron-donating effect that destabilizes the conjugate base.",
      "category": "Carboxylic Acids",
      "detailedExplanation": "The conjugate base of benzoic acid (benzoate ion) is stabilized by resonance delocalization of the negative charge over the entire carboxylate group and into the aromatic ring. In contrast, the methyl group in acetate ion has a +I (electron-donating) effect that increases electron density on the carboxylate oxygen, making it less stable. This greater stability of benzoate ion makes benzoic acid a stronger acid (pKa ≈ 4.2) compared to acetic acid (pKa ≈ 4.76).",

      "question": "Why is CH₃CHO more reactive than CH₃COCH₃ towards reaction with HCN?",
      "answer": "CH₃CHO is more reactive than CH₃COCH₃ because aldehydes have less steric hindrance and greater electrophilicity at the carbonyl carbon compared to ketones.",
      "category": "Aldehydes/Ketones",
      "detailedExplanation": "Two factors make aldehydes more reactive than ketones towards nucleophilic addition: 1) Steric effect: Aldehydes have one small H atom and one R group, while ketones have two R groups creating more steric hindrance around the carbonyl carbon. 2) Electronic effect: Alkyl groups are electron-donating, so ketones have more electron density on carbonyl carbon, making it less electrophilic. Both factors make nucleophilic attack easier on aldehydes than ketones.",

      "question": "Why is chloracetic acid more acidic than acetic acid?",
      "answer": "Chloracetic acid is more acidic than acetic acid because the -I (electron-withdrawing) effect of chlorine stabilizes the conjugate base by dispersing the negative charge.",
      "category": "Carboxylic Acids",
      "detailedExplanation": "Chlorine is highly electronegative and exerts a strong -I effect. In chloracetate ion, the electron-withdrawing chlorine atom helps to disperse the negative charge on the carboxylate group, making the conjugate base more stable. This increased stability of the conjugate base makes chloracetic acid a stronger acid. The pKa values are: acetic acid (4.76) and chloracetic acid (2.87).",

        "-I effect of chlorine stabilizes conjugate base",

      "question": "Why does aromatic carboxylic acids not undergo Friedel-Crafts reaction?",
      "answer": "Aromatic carboxylic acids do not undergo Friedel-Crafts reaction because the carboxyl group deactivates the ring and coordinates with the Lewis acid catalyst, making both the catalyst and substrate unavailable.",
      "category": "Carboxylic Acids",
      "detailedExplanation": "Two reasons prevent Friedel-Crafts reaction in aromatic carboxylic acids: 1) The -COOH group is strongly deactivating and meta-directing due to -I and -R effects, making the ring less electron-rich and unreactive towards electrophilic substitution. 2) The carbonyl oxygen can coordinate with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), forming a complex that deactivates the catalyst. This dual deactivation prevents the reaction from occurring.",

      "question": "Why is α-hydrogen of carbonyl compounds acidic in nature?",
      "answer": "The α-hydrogen of carbonyl compounds is acidic because the carbanion formed after deprotonation is stabilized by resonance with the carbonyl group.",
      "category": "Carbonyl Compounds",
      "detailedExplanation": "When α-hydrogen is removed from a carbonyl compound, it forms a carbanion that is stabilized through resonance with the adjacent carbonyl group. The negative charge on the α-carbon delocalizes onto the oxygen atom, forming an enolate ion. This resonance stabilization makes the α-hydrogen relatively acidic. The pKa of α-hydrogens in carbonyl compounds is around 16-20, much lower than typical alkane C-H bonds (pKa ~ 50).",

      "question": "Why is oxidation of propanal easier than propanone?",
      "answer": "Oxidation of propanal is easier than propanone because aldehydes have a hydrogen atom attached to the carbonyl carbon that can be easily oxidized, while ketones require carbon-carbon bond cleavage.",
      "category": "Aldehydes/Ketones",
      "detailedExplanation": "Aldehydes can be easily oxidized to carboxylic acids using mild oxidizing agents because they have a hydrogen atom directly attached to the carbonyl carbon (R-CHO → R-COOH). Ketones lack this hydrogen and require stronger conditions and carbon-carbon bond cleavage for oxidation. This makes aldehyde oxidation much more facile and occurs under milder conditions.",

      "category": "Carbonyl Compounds",
      "detailedExplanation": "The Wolff-Kishner reduction involves heating a carbonyl compound with hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂) in the presence of a strong base like KOH in high-boiling solvent like ethylene glycol. The reaction proceeds through formation of a hydrazone intermediate which decomposes to give the hydrocarbon and nitrogen gas. Overall: R₂C=O → R₂CH₂ + N₂.
