      "question": "What is a semiconductor?",
      "answer": "A semiconductor is a material whose electrical conductivity lies between that of a conductor and an insulator.",
      "category": "Basics",
      "detailedExplanation": "Semiconductors are materials that do not conduct electricity as freely as metals but are not perfect insulators either. Their conductivity can be controlled by temperature, light, and impurity addition (doping). This controllable behavior makes them essential for electronic devices.\n\nAt low temperatures, semiconductors behave like insulators. As temperature increases, more charge carriers become available, increasing conductivity.",
